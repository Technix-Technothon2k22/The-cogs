# Electro-Node

An Electricity outage tracking app built by the Team Cogs, during the event Technothon 2022 held at Goa Engineering College(GEC).

## Problem Statement:

> During the rainy season, there are regular power outages. The electricity department currently relies on end consumers to warn them of power disruptions. It can take a long time to determine where the problem is. Come up with a solution to track the power outages using IoT (Assume you are receiving data from IoT devices).
